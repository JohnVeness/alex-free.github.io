# That Link Doesn't Exist :(

This link may have worked before, but now may not due to:

*   Improvements in the website layout and or re-organization have changed the link to somewhere else.

*   Typo in linking to the page/content.

*   That content has been removed/obsoleted for whatever reason.

*   The link never existed in the first place.

**If you got here from a link on this website itself, please open an [issue](https://github.com/alex-free/alex-free.github.io/issues) on Github so that I may correct it!** Otherwise, please try to find what your here for on the [home page](https://alex-free.github.io). You may also want to see what has [recently changed](https://github.com/alex-free/alex-free.github.io/commits/master/) on the website.
