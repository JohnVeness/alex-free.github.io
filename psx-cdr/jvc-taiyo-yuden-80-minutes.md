## JVC Taiyo Yuden (80 Minutes)

JVC merged with Taiyo Yuden in [2009](https://forums.stevehoffman.tv/threads/taiyo-yuden-jvc.190046/), and globally labeled their professional line as JVC Taiyo Yuden until 12/31/2015 when the last Taiyo Yuden factory closed.

Atip info while not yet confirmed, should be the exact same as the [CMC Pro Powered By Taiyo Yuden Technology (80 Minutes)](#cmc-pro-powered-by-taiyo-yuden-technology-80-minutes), which replaced it.
