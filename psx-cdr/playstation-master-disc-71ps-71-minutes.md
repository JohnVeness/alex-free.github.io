## PlayStation Master Disc 71PS CD-R (71 Minutes)

Taiyo Yuden [invented](https://www.microboards.com/resources/the-history-of-taiyo-yuden) the CD-R in 1988 with Sony and Phillips. Taiyo Yuden would remain the best in the industry (until being bought out by CMC, although their technology and techniques would [live on](#cmc-pro-powered-by-taiyo-yuden-technology-80-minutes) in a single product line still made today).

Sony contracted Taiyo Yuden to create a special 'That's CD-R' brand with a 71 minute capacity to match the expected density of a full 12CM pressed PSX CDROM disc (there is one known [officially licensed PSX 8CM mini CDROM disc](https://www.yaronet.com/topics/171270-mini-cd-ps1-de-8-cm)). The PlayStation Master Disc 71PS CD-R (71 Minutes) was the only acceptable media for testing in development PSX titles, and also was the required media type be sent to Sony as the final build in order to ship the game and press the PSX CD-ROMs for retail.
