## Verbatim 80 Minute

These are what have ruined Verbatim's repution in consumer grade media. The ATIP info confirms that they are made by the CMC Magnetics manufacturing proccess, and not the original Verbatim consumer grade one. Don't get scammed! I call these 'fake Verbatims' and they are only marginally better then the [Maxell 80 Minute CD-Rs](maxell-cd-r-80-minute.md).


Just like with the [Maxell 80 Minute CD-Rs](maxell-cd-r-80-minute.md) the 'music' branding is [just a tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_copying_levy) (that just make these more expensive), all pictures below are the same horrible quality media. 

Note: I don't have any of these at the moment to show the ATIP info.
