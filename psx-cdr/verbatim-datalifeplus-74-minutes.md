## Verbatim DataLifePlus (74 Minutes)

I've used them in the past and they work well, but not much worse then higher quality manufacturers like Taiyo Yuden. These use the original AZO dye formulation, which doesn't support burning at faster then 8x speed.

Huge thanks to [akikokumagara](https://gbatemp.net/members/akikokumagara.410237/) for [these pictures](https://gbatemp.net/threads/do-modern-burners-cds-make-lower-quality-ps1-backups.628708/page-3#post-10223678) since I don't have any around at the moment myself. The bottom right of the back cover for these discs has the **copyright date of 1997 or 1999**.

Notice the super deep blue AZO dye. This is the original formulation, it was changed at some point to a lighter blue to increase the burn speed support from 8x to higher. **These discs will fail to burn at any higher speed then 8x**.
